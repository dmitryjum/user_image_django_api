# Decision-Making Notes for the Image API Project

## Use of Environment Variables for Configuration

In developing the Image API, one of the key decisions was to utilize environment variables for configuration management. This approach enhances security by keeping sensitive information, such as database credentials and API keys, out of the source code. By using a `.env` file in conjunction with the `python-decouple` package, the application can easily access these variables without hardcoding them. This not only protects sensitive data but also provides flexibility, allowing different configurations for development, testing, and production environments without modifying the codebase.

## Implementation of Bulk Upsert for Performance

Another decision was to implement bulk upsert functionality when seeding the database with initial images. Using the `django-pgbulk` package allowed for efficient insertion and updating of records in a single database operation. This approach improves performance compared to inserting records one at a time (in a loop), especially when dealing with large datasets. The bulk upsert method ensures that the application can handle data more efficiently, reducing the time required for database operations and enhancing overall responsiveness. I think it's especially useful, if the seed script set in a cron job on a schedule repeated basis.

## Pagination for Enhanced User Experience

To improve user experience, pagination was incorporated into the image retrieval functionality. By limiting the number of images returned in a single request, the API can provide faster responses and reduce the load on both the server and the client. This is particularly important when dealing with large datasets. The pagination implementation also makes the API more user-friendly, allowing clients to request specific pages of results.

## Index Considerations

To further enhance query performance, indexes were added to the database columns used for filtering, such as `author`, `width`, and `height`. By indexing these fields, the application can retrieve data more efficiently, especially when handling large datasets. Single column indexes are sufficient for the current query patterns, as the application primarily filters on individual fields.
